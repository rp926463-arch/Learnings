Dear ,

I hope this email finds you well.

It is with mixed emotions that I write to inform you of my decision to resign from my current position at Morgan Stanley, effective today [date].

While I have not had the opportunity to work directly with you, I want to express my gratitude for the support and guidance provided by the previous team during my time at Morgan Stanley.

While it's bittersweet to bid farewell to such a dynamic people's, I have made the difficult decision to pursue a new opportunity that I believe will allow me to further develop my skills and contribute meaningfully to the field.

I want to assure you that I am fully committed to ensuring a smooth transition during my remaining time with the company. I am more than willing to assist in training my replacement and completing any outstanding projects to the best of my ability. Please don't hesitate to let me know how I can be of assistance in this process.

I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt appreciation for the support, guidance, and camaraderie I have experienced at Morgan Stanley. The memories and lessons learned here will always hold a special place in my heart.

Thank you once again for everything. I sincerely wish you and the entire team continued success and prosperity in all your future endeavors.

Warm regards,
Roshan
